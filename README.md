# Maze-Solver
A maze solving Program. Given a maze file that fits the following criteria, the program finds a path from the start to the end using three different algorithms.

Maze File Criteria:
1.First line of the file is the dimensions of the maze Height x Width.
2.Start is marked with the 'S' character, Exit is marked with 'E', empty space is marked with '.', and walls are marked with any other character. 

The program applies three maze solving algorithms:
1. Depth first search.
2. Breadth first search.
3. Best first search.
